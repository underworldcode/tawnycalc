@ P
"""
Pressure in the system, in kbar.
"""

@ T
"""
Temperature in the system, in degC.
"""

@ bulk_composition
"""
Table: The oxide units used to define the bulk composition of the system, 
       and the percentages of those oxide units present.
"""

@ modes
"""
Table: The phases present in the stable assemblage, and their modes
       (modal proportions).
"""

@ output_tc_ic
"""
A string representing the complete contents of the main THERMOCALC output
file, tc-<rootname>-ic.txt, defining the most stable assemblage calculated.
"""

@ rbi
"""
The rbi block representing the most stable assemblage calculated.

Each row in the rbi block represents a phase. For each phase, the first 
column represents the "mode" (modal proportion) - the proportion of atoms 
that it contributes to the system. Subsequent columns provide the number
of each oxide unit in the phase, normalised to one formula unit of the 
phase. 

N.B. For most phases, but not for all, there is a single generally accepted 
formula unit. In THERMOCALC/TawnyCALC, a phases is built on a set of 
end-members drawn from the Holland & Powell dataset. The formula unit is 
therefore inherited from the choice of end-members in the Holland & Powell
dataset.

"""

@ site_fractions
"""
The occupancy of model mixing sites for each phase in the most-stable 
calculated assemblage. Syntax for the site fraction is e.g.
   xMgM1:    Fraction of Mg2+ on the M1 mixing site
             Values of all ions on the M1 site (i.e. xZM1 for any Z) will
             sum to 1.

"""

@ thermodynamic_properties
"""
A table of key thermodynamic properties:

     mode        f           G           H           S        V         rho

for each phase in the most stable calculated assemblage.

mode    Proportion of phase in the system, on a per-atom basis.

f       Calculated as: atoms_in_system/(100 atoms_per_formula_unit)
        A scaling factor for converting extensive properties on a 
        formula unit basis, as shown here, to a per-atom basis, 
        needed to establish the partial contributions of the phase
        to the bulk properties of the system.

G, H    Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, in kJ per mole formula unit.

S       Entropy, in kJ/K per mole formula unit.

V       Volume, in kJ/kbar per mole formula unit.

rho     Density, as "specific gravity", i.e. relative to the density
        of standard state H2O.

Values for G, H, S, V and rho are also provided for the whole assemblage -
the "bulk properties of the system" - labelled 'sys'.

For details of how the thermodynamic properties are constructed, start 
by visiting hpxeosandthermocalc.org.

Calibration of the thermodynamics of phases is focused on G. The derived 
properties, V, S and rho, are significantly less well constrained.
"""

xyz
"""
Composition of the variable-composition phases in the most stable calculated
assemblage, presented as a variable:value dictionary, and expressed in 
THERMOCALC's internal variables. These values can be used as starting guesses
in a subsequent calculation.
