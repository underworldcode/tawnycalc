`tawnycalc` provides tools for the orchestration of `thermocalc` simulations
from a Python environment.

This package operates as a high level wrapper to `thermocalc`, allowing 
users to configure, execute and analyse their models. Generally models will
be configured in one of two ways:

1. Utilise existing `thermocalc` setup scripts. In this case `tawnycalc` 
   will read in the existing input files and present them as Python objects
   for further modification. This is useful for where you have an existing 
   model that you would like to control from Python.
2. Start from scratch. Here the user will generate the entire configuration
   required for `thermocalc` from within Python. This workflow consolidates 
   your entire model configuration to the Python environment which may 
   provide a more streamlined experience. 

Once configured satisfactorily, execution is performed as follows:

1. `tawnycalc` utilises the current `Context` configuration to generate
   `thermocalc` input files. These files are generated in either a temporary
   or user specified location
2. A sub-process is spawned which executes `thermocalc` against the generated
   input files. 

The results of the `thermocalc` execution are then parsed by `tawnycalc` and 
provided as Python objects for analysis. The user may use the results to 
determine the input configuration for further `thermocalc` executions.

Note that this package does not provide the required `thermocalc` executable 
itself. Refer to the `tawnycalc.Context` class for further information.
