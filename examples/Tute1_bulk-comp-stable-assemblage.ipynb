    "## Bulk composition\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we're considering some package of geological material (the \"system\"). Its nature and behaviour depend on its chemical composition - the **bulk composition**. The term \"bulk\" refers to a property of the the whole system, rather than a property of an individual mineral or fluid phases within the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at a representative bulk composition for a mid-ocean ridge basalt (**MORB**), as determined by Sun & McDonough (1989; in: Geol. Soc. London Special Publications, 42, 313-345).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "### The chemical system is composed of phases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase equilibrium modelling** lets us predict which phases (different minerals and fluids) would be present in our system, if it were in thermodynamic equilibrium - an approximation that we're often happy to make. The phases present are a function of bulk composition, temperature, and pressure (strictly, stress, but we will ignore this complication for now). For example, here are some predictions for MORB:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Pressure (kbar) | Temperature (degC) | Phases in most stable equilibrium\n",
    "|:-------------- |:------------------ |:---------------------------------\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that in the two calculations at 1150C, melt is part of the stable assemblage. This is significant because the melt is relatively mobile, and may escape from the package of solid material, which itself may be stationary or else following a tectonically-determined path. If the melt escapes, it will change the bulk composition of our system, and of the surrounding material that it infiltrates, driving changes in the equilibrium phase assemblage. It may also transport significant heat, and modify local stress fields.\n",

    "- What happens to the system if its bulk composition is changed, by addition of an aqueous fluid.\n",
    "\n",
